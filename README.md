# nadra-project
This project is a beginner-level website inspired by the NADRA system. It is designed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice web development skills. The website includes a clean layout, navigation menu, and informational sections similar to a real NADRA website. This project helped me understand website structure, styling, and basic interactivity, and improved my confidence as a beginner web developer.
